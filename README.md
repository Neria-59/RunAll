# Overview
**This is a library for running the concurrent processing using only native Google Apps Script (GAS).**


<a name="Description"></a>
# Description
Have you ever thought about the concurrent processing using only native Google Apps Script (GAS)? So far, I had run the concurrent processing using golang, javascript and python. But the script cannot be used by the trigger event, because these are not native GAS. Recently, it was found that [the fetchAll method](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/url-fetch/url-fetch-app#fetchAll(Object)) added by the Google's update at January 19, 2018 is [worked by the asynchronous processing](https://gist.github.com/tanaikech/c0f383034045ab63c19604139ecb0728). By this, the concurrent processing using the native GAS got to be able to be achieved. This library makes users work the concurrent processing of functions using the fetchAll method and the execution API. This can drastically reduce the process cost in the script. And also this can be used under the trigger event. So it is considered that it will be useful for both the limit executing time of 6 minutes for GAS and the limit total executing time of 1 hour/day for the trigger event.

# How to install
In order to use this library, please install this library, deploy API executable and enable Apps Script API. You can see the flow of them as follows.

1. Prepare a project.
    - Create new project and please do the following flow at this project.
    - If you want to use this library at the existing project, please do the following flow at the existing project.
    - You can use this library for both the standalone type and the container-bound script type.
1. [Install RunAll library](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/libraries).
    - Library's project key is **``1FWYhQFhL7UIAZJn-FR3TlcHvXwHPJc2HwI4vtmNUAQv2OybGe-S97Lal``**.
1. [Deploy API executable](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/api/how-tos/execute#step_1_deploy_the_script_as_an_api_executable).
    1. On script editor
        - "Publish" -> "Deploy as API executable"
        - Input version for "version" as NEW.
        - Select "Only myself" for Who has access to the script".

        - **Enable "Google Apps Script API"**
1. **Also here [https://script.google.com/home/usersettings](https://script.google.com/home/usersettings) has to be enabled. Please turn ON.**

> **IMPORTANT!**

> **<u>After installed the library, please push the save button at the script editor.</u>** This is very important! By this, the library is completely reflected.

> Even if the apps script API is enabled and API executable is deployed. when the following error is returned, please push the save button at the script editor.
> ``{"error": {"code": 404, "message": "Requested entity was not found.", "status": "NOT_FOUND"}}``


## How to enable Apps Script API directly
If you know project ID of the script that you use, you can directly access to the page to enable API using your browser.

- For Apps Script API
    - ``https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/script.googleapis.com/?project=### project ID ###``


## About scopes
About the install of scopes used at this library, users are not required to install scopes. Because this library can automatically install the required scopes to the project which installed this library. The detail information about this can be seen at [here](https://gist.github.com/tanaikech/23ddf599a4155b66f1029978bba8153b).

The following scopes are installed in this library.

- ``https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive``
- ``https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.scripts``
- ``https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.external_request``


# Usage
A sample script is as follows. This sample script runs 2 works for ``myFunction()``. The functions to use at Apps Script API are put in the same project with the project installed this library. When you use this sample script, at first, please carry out the above [installation flow](#Howtoinstall).

~~~javascript
function myFunction(e) {
  Utilities.sleep(1000);
  return e;
}

function main() {
  // Please set "workers.length < 30".
  var workers = [
    {
      functionName: "myFunction",
      arguments: ["request1"],
    },
    {
      functionName: "myFunction",
      arguments: ["request2"],
    },
  ];
  var results = RunAll.Do(workers); // Using this library
  Logger.log(results);
}
~~~

When the installation is fine, you can see the following result.

~~~
[
  {
    "done": true,
    "response": {
      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.apps.script.v1.ExecutionResponse",
      "result": "request1"
    }
  },
  {
    "done": true,
    "response": {
      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.apps.script.v1.ExecutionResponse",
      "result": "request2"
    }
  }
]
~~~

- In this sample, when ``main()`` is run, the script is launched.
    - ``myFunction()`` is used by Apps Script API.
- Object of workers is constructed by JSON array with the keys of ``functionName`` and ``arguments``.
    - "functionName" is the function name for running by this library.
    - "arguments" is the arguments giving to the function which is used for running.
    - Please set ``workers.length < 30``.
- "results" retrieved by ``RunAll.Do(workers)`` is the same to that retrieved by the fetchAll method. So each result for the each request is in "results" which is the 1 dimensional array.
    - The data retrieved by the fetchAll is [Class HTTPResponse](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/url-fetch/http-response) for each element. So you can use each method for Class HTTPResponse like ``getContentText()``, ``getResponseCode()`` and so on.
    - The each element of the result array is from [Method: scripts.run](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/api/reference/rest/v1/scripts/run).


# Limitation of workers
When a function is run by Apps Script API, it is considered that there is the limiation for the number of simultaneous connections. Here, it was measured.

<br>

![](images/fig1.png)

Fig. 1: Number of workers vs. elapsed time. At the function for working, ``Utilities.sleep(1000)`` is used. So the data points are existing near 1 s.

<br>

![](images/fig2.png)

Fig. 2: Number of workers vs. number of workers without errors. Horizontal axis is the number of workers. Vertical axis is the number of workers which subtracted the number of errors from the total workers, when the results were returned.

<br>

Figure 1 is the typical result for the number of workers vs. elapsed time. From Fig. 1, the elapsed time is almost no change with the increase in the number of workers. At the function for working, ``Utilities.sleep(1000)`` is used. This indicates that RunAll is working with the concurrent processing. Figure 2 is the typical result for the number of workers vs. number of workers without errors. Figure 2 indicates that when the number of workers is more than 30, the number of living workers is almost the constant of about 30. All other workers have errors as follows.

~~~
{
  "done": true,
  "error": {
    "code": 3,
    "message": "ScriptError",
    "details": [
      {
        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.apps.script.v1.ExecutionError",
        "errorMessage": "Service invoked too many times in a short time: exec qps. Try Utilities.sleep(1000) between calls.",
        "errorType": "ScriptError"
      }
    ]
  }
}
~~~

These results indicate that the number of workers is required to be under 30. For above sample script, the length of workers has to be under 30. If the number of workers is more than 30, the error is included in the returned results. Also this means that the limitation of number of simultaneous connections for Apps Script API is 30. It could be also confirmed that this result was the same to Web Apps. As the result, in the current stage, it was found that the concurrent processing using native GAS can be achieved. And when you uset this library, please set ``workers.length < 30``.




# Future
[It has already known that the limitation of number of requests for the fetchAll method is more than 1000.](https://gist.github.com/tanaikech/c0f383034045ab63c19604139ecb0728) So if the several servers of Apps Script API and Web Apps are used for this situation and furthermore such clients are aggregated as a system, it is considered that the concurrent processing with the high spec using native GAS can be produced. As more update of this library, I would like to try to create such system.
